    "## Introduction to AirSim\n",
    "\n",
    "AirSim (Aerial Informatics and Robotics Simulation) is an open-source robotics simulation platform developed by Microsoft Research, primarily used for algorithm development and testing of autonomous systems such as drones and self-driving cars. The following introduces AirSim from three aspects: core functionalities, technical features, and application scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### I. Core Functionalities\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-modal Simulation Support**  \n",
    "   AirSim supports the simulation of various types of vehicles, including drones, ground vehicles, and static IoT devices, providing a high-fidelity physical and visual simulation environment. Its built-in sensor models (e.g., IMU, GPS, cameras, LiDAR) can generate data that closely resembles real-world conditions, suitable for training and validating AI models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hardware-in-the-Loop and Software-in-the-Loop Simulation**  \n",
    "   The platform supports integration with flight controllers such as PX4 and ArduPilot, enabling Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) and Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) simulations. This allows developers to combine real hardware with virtual environments for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Generation and Debugging Tools**  \n",
    "   AirSim can efficiently generate large-scale training data and simulate high-risk scenarios such as collisions and complex weather conditions to reduce the cost of real-world testing. For example, simulating drone crashes incurs almost no cost but provides valuable information for improving designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### II. Technical Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Realistic Rendering Based on Unreal Engine**  \n",
    "   As a plugin for Unreal Engine, AirSim leverages the engineâ€™s physics computation and graphics rendering capabilities to create highly realistic 3D scenes (e.g., cities, mountains, indoor environments), making it ideal for developing vision-dependent navigation algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Modular Design and Cross-platform Compatibility**  \n",
    "   With a modular architecture, AirSim supports the extension of hardware and algorithm interfaces, and is compatible with both Windows and Linux systems. It enables flexible control through Python and C++ APIs, as well as ROS/ROS2 interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multi-drone Cooperative Simulation**  \n",
    "   By configuring files, multiple drones can be simulated simultaneously, supporting distributed control and verification of complex tasks (e.g., formation flying), meeting the needs of research and education.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### III. Application Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Autonomous Driving Algorithm Development**: Simulate vehicle perception and decision-making in complex traffic conditions to accelerate deep learning model training.\n",
    "- **Drone Obstacle Avoidance and Path Planning**: Test SLAM and autonomous navigation algorithms in GPS-denied environments (e.g., inside buildings).\n",
    "- **Education and Research**: Provide a low-cost experimental platform for robotics education and reinforcement learning research.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current Status and Development\n",
    "\n",
    "As of 2025, the official open-source version of AirSim has ceased updates and has been archived, although users can still access the historical codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, several teams continue to develop and improve upon AirSim, such as:\n",
    "- [Cosys-AirSim](https://github.com/Cosys-Lab/Cosys-AirSim): Adds more sensors and upgrades to Unreal Engine 5.\n",
    "- [Colosseum](https://github.com/CodexLabsLLC/Colosseum): Optimizes deployment workflows by adapting to Windows systems and Unreal Engine 5."
