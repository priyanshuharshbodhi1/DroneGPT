## Project Overview  
**DroneGPT-OSS: Advanced Drone Control with OpenAI's gpt-oss Reasoning Models**

üèÜ **Submitted to OpenAI Open Model Hackathon - "Best in Robotics" Category**

This project demonstrates the unique capabilities of **OpenAI's gpt-oss** (open-weight reasoning models) for autonomous drone control. Using natural language instructions, gpt-oss provides advanced reasoning, safety analysis, and mission planning for both simulated and real drone operations.

## üß† Why gpt-oss for Drone Control?  

**gpt-oss** brings unprecedented reasoning capabilities to robotics:
- **Advanced spatial reasoning** for complex 3D navigation
- **Multi-step mission planning** with safety considerations  
- **Real-time decision making** for dynamic environments
- **Reasoning effort control** (low/medium/high) for different scenarios

Unlike traditional LLMs, gpt-oss can **think through** complex drone missions step-by-step, considering safety margins, obstacle avoidance, and emergency protocols.

## Introduction to AirSim  
AirSim is an open-source drone and autonomous vehicle simulator designed to provide a high-fidelity simulation environment for research and development of drones and autonomous vehicles. Developed by Microsoft, it supports a variety of sensor simulations such as cameras and LiDAR, and can interface with multiple programming languages like Python and C++.

## Project Architecture  
Our project combines **gpt-oss** and **AirSim**, leveraging the powerful reasoning capabilities of open source large language models from OpenAI to enable autonomous drone flight within the AirSim environment.

The system adopts a typical **embodied intelligence framework**, where gpt-oss provides key planning, perception, and decision-making capabilities.
